## Testing softwares

### Wave

We already covered Wave in the [🔧 Assistive technologies : Desktop](A-ITD.md) module. [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a testing software to automatically detect warnings and errors related to the [WCAG Accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). It’s as simple as entering your domain to see prevalent issues with your website.

While you might be working on a native app, it’s very likely that you or your organization have a website along with it. Wave is a very convenient way to check if you’re also up to date on that end without necessitating further knowledge.

Still be careful not to believe blindly the feedback form automated tools lke Wave. **It will often make mistakes** and is not a substitute for *savoir-faire* in any way.
