## When to use

This module should be used when already having a basis of what accessibility and inclusiveness means as well as how they interact together. It should help trainees have more concrete examples of what working on accessibility will mean technically.

## Main disabilities to account for in softwares

### Low vision

### Deafness

### Cognitive impairment

### Motor disabilities

## Intersectional needs

In the [🎨 Inclusive design 101](C-IDE.md) module we will develop further the intersectional needs to take into account. Before that, a *non-exhaustive* list of human characteristics to keep in mind in order to try and include as many user as possible would be:

- Age
- Culture
- Digital literacy
- Education
- Ethnicity
- Gender, gender identity
- Historical context
- Language
- Mental health
- Nationality
- Physical *and* cognitive (dis)abilities
- Sexuality
- Socio-economic context

!!! tip
    **You need to consider the intersections of all of those categories as well as the disabilities listed previously in the first section of this module.**

Realistically, you cannot predict and account perfectly for all of those characteristics, because they are spectrums rather than fixed labels. The best you can do, is actively seek and listen to feedback from diverse user groups and make sure your team is as diverse as possible.

Some of the tools that we will share later in this training should still help you go through the main accessibility and inclusiveness elements when designing and developing.
