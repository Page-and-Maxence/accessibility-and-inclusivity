# ⚗️ B-IDP: Inclusive development pipeline

### 2.1 Accessibility workflows

Accessibility is a complex topic that can be tricky to incorporate into your structure's workflows, especially with varying team compositions and scales. Accessibility pipelines as used at industrial scale is likely to be incompatible with small structures providing FOSS. Therefore, we need to adapt existing accessibility workflows to smaller scales.

**Working with the designers**

TODO: working with design, not listen to them blindly

**Implementing the accessibility**

**Testing the accessibility**

**Having an accessibility coach**

The most useful tip regarding this topic that we found in the [Agile Accessibility Handbook](https://accessibility.deque.com/agile-accessibility-handbook) would be the concept of accessibility coach. Each development team can have someone especially knowledgeable and with a consequent empathy regarding accessibility. These coach will not be the one doing the core accessibility work and don't need to be working full time on accessibility. They will rather **be the ones who monitor with other employees the progress of the current accessibility roadmap**. They are the one responsible of making sure that accessibility is a constant thought at every step of development.

The coach of different teams can meet regularly to coordinate and update the accessibility roadmap of the application. They also can organize monthly meetings with the all of their teams to report on the improvements, blockers and perspectives. The main goal is to normalize accessibility and inclusiveness as routine parts of development.

We highly recommend creating a template of issues for accessibility and encouraging users and developers to fill them when encountering an issue. This would make it easier for developers to pic up an accessibility issue in the backlog and fix it.

If you want to learn further on this topic, the [Agile Accessibility Handbook](https://accessibility.deque.com/agile-accessibility-handbook) mentioned previously is a very solid starting point.
