# Building Inclusive Open Source Software 

## What is it?

Despite being deeply based on values of sharing and empowerment, FOSS projects often fail at being inclusive. This project aims at providing accessibility and inclusiveness knowledge for organizations or individuals who build open-source software.

This repository contains short training modules (ranging from 10 to 30 minutes), which can either be dispensed to teams as workshop, or individually read as articles. These modules cover a wide range of subjects, from conceptual and historical background on accessibility and inclusiveness, to design and programming guidelines.

These modules should not be seen as holding the truth regarding the subjects tackled, but rather as a condensed introduction which goal is to help teams get started with accessibility and inclusiveness for their product.

The easiest way to access the content is via [the static web site built from this repository](https://page-and-maxence.github.io/accessibility-and-inclusiveness/).

## Where does it come from?

This project started out as a collaborative internship project between Page Magnier--Slimani ([Savoir-Faire Linux](https://savoirfairelinux.com/fr)) and Maxence Vahedi ([Olvid](https://olvid.io)), which goal was to provide accessibility and inclusiveness resources to their teams and to the FOSS community.

Please note that the original authors are not accessibility or inclusiveness experts, but passionate people who did their best to provide qualitative content and who will be happy to get *any* feedback or contribution you may have!
