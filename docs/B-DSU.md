# ü§∫ B-DSU: Developer stance & user collaboration

    When creating, finding the right stance can be perilous;
        - how to help without infantilizing ?
        - How to care without assuming one's needs ?
        - How to design for something we don't experience ?

    This module aims at finding answers to those questions from a software
    perspective.

# When to use ?

This module try and provide you with a reflection on what your perspective on the world is and how to attempt to account for other's ones.

# Description

## Who are you

Who are we as people ? We all have an incomplete perspective of the world. These comes with biases but also insights and experiences. Opening up to different views is always a tough process. In [Developing Inclusive Mobile Apps](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5814-9), Rob Whitetaker propose an exercise to identify our biases. The following workshop is a variation adapted from their's.

Provide a piece of paper to all of the trainees attempting the training. Ask them to make a list of five person the 5 peoples they trust the must, people they would go to for advices (no matter whether they are colleagues, family or friends). Once that's done, ask them to count a point each time the answer is yes to the following questions.

1. Are all of them of the same ethnicity as you ?
2. Are all of them straight ?
3. Do all of them have the same nationality as you ?
4. Are all of them considered valid ?
5. Did all of them have or are pursuing a diploma ?
6. Are all of them cisgender ?
7. Are none of them unemployed ?
8. Are all of them from the same or higher economic background as you ?
9. Are most of them women and gender minority ?
10. Do they all speak the language of the country they live in ?

Once that's done, count from 1 up to 10 and ask the trainees to raise their hand on the number corresponding with their score. T ease of trainees you can also raise your hand on the number corresponding to your own results. This should help the group to start reflecting on their own biases. Note that you can adapt those questions to fit the cultural environment in which you give this formation.

## Who is disabled

Who exactly is disabled is a question with no evident answer.
## Who do you want to be ?



In [Against Technoableism: rethinking who needs improvement](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324036661), Ashley Shew talks largely about expertise on accessibility. While disabled experts are often not taken seriously, some of their valid peers consider themselves experts at understanding one's needs. She states:

    Throughout, I consider disabled people the experts about disability. I‚Äôm no longer interested in what so-called experts (nondisabled scientists, physicians, therapists, and so on) have to say. These narratives are already overrepresented, and in some cases, they have done damage to disabled people as a community, disabled people as knowers, and the experience of disability as valid and valuable. When we don‚Äôt listen to those with actual experience, we often get accounts of disability and technology completely wrong. Disabled people are ‚Äúthe real experts‚Äù (the title of Michelle Sutton‚Äôs 2015 edited volume about and authored by autistic people) when it comes to technology and disability. We use technologies. We also reject them, grapple with them, or repurpose them. The views on technology we get from listening to disabled people often look very different from those of people educated in the medical and ‚Äúhelping‚Äù professions.
