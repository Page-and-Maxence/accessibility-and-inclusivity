## When to use ?

Use this module to kick off the training. It is useful to get a collective feeling of how is the room‚Äôs initial knowledge and interest about the subject.

## Description

Participants are asked a few questions which results are then shown on the screen and discussed collectively.

These questions can include:

- On a scale from one to ten, how do you evaluate your knowledge about accessibility ?
- How much time do you typically spend on accessibility issues during a week ?
- Is there something preventing you from dealing with the topic as much as you would ideally like to ?

Between each question, it can be useful to discuss collectively the results, avoiding the awkward situation where participants would fill out the answers and remain silent.

It can be a good idea to ask the participants possible explanations of these results, rather than asking them to explain their own answer, as we would not want anyone feeling ashamed about their initial position.
