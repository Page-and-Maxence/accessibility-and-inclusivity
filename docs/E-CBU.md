This section is a reorganized synthesis of the whole training.

### Accessibility is nothing without inclusiveness

Inclusiveness is a core concept when talking about diversity. It's often a preferred term to accessibility that is rather limited to the inclusion of people with disabilities. It highlights that we need to be designing and programming not only for accessability but also for the ever-varying pluralities of human experiences and discriminations. In simpler words, not being ableist is not enough. We must make sure that we are also not perpetuating other kinds of oppressions.

Here is a *non-exhaustive* list of human characteristics to keep in mind in order to try and include as many user as possible:

- Age
- Culture
- Digital literacy
- Education
- Ethnicity
- Gender, gender identity
- Historical context
- Language
- Mental health
- Nationality
- Physical *and* cognitive (dis)abilities
- Sexuality
- Socio-economic context


Intersectionality is a framework for understanding specific living experiences of people situated at the intersection of discriminations and privileges.
It‚Äôs very useful, for two main reasons:

- The proportion of users with disabilities who happen to have more than one is important ([17.7% in 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11545900/)). Thinking about designing for one disability leaves out a blank spot for users having that disability but also other conditions. For example, deaf users with low vision are often overlooked when thinking about accessibility.

- It‚Äôs a common bias to forget that disabled people are not just disabled, but first and foremost people with their own unique life experiences and specificities. We need to think about disabled women, disabled queers, disabled Arabs and those who are all of that at once!

!!!Tip
    **It's crucial to not think disabled peoples as a minority but rather as the living diversity that we will all become.**

### Accessibility and inclusiveness need to be intentional

Disability shouldn't be thought as an internal characteristic. Environment - and the way it is designed - plays an equal role as the body when it comes to disability. For example, in an environment built to be completely flat and non-obstructed, people who walk are way slower than people using a wheelchair.

!!! Quote "Rob Whitaker, *[Developing Inclusive Mobile Apps](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5814-9)*"
    Disability is not a binary state. We all have "abilities and limits to those abilities. Disability happens when we have built something that doesn‚Äôt work for someone with particular skills.

Additionally, by default we tend to design for people that we imagine being like us. Not thinking about accessibility is a privilege because most disabled people don't have the choice to think about it. Not developing with accessibility and inclusiveness in mind will is ableist and reinforce biases against minorities in software.

Accessibility and inclusiveness are very hard to automate. No amount of checklists and tests in CI can replace feedback and testing from diverse user groups. You shouldn't listen blindly to automated tools but rather develop your empathic gaze and listen to diverse feedback.

!!! Tip
    **Accessibility and inclusiveness are a shift in how you perceive otherness, not a task to be done.**



### Disabled people are the real experts on accessibility

We cannot replace the perspectives of people with disabilities simply by reading about them or running a series of automated tests. We highly encourage recruiting people from diverse backgrounds in your team. The whole project will benefit from varying perspectives and it could help to leverage against systemic exclusion and hiring discriminations which affect minorities.

!!! Quote "Ashley Shew, *[Against Technoableism, Rethinking Who Needs Improvement](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324036661)*"
    Disabled people are ‚Äúthe real experts‚Äù (the title of Michelle Sutton‚Äôs 2015 edited volume about and authored by autistic people) when it comes to technology and disability. We use technologies. We also reject them, grapple with them, or repurpose them. The views on technology we get from listening to disabled people often look very different from those of people educated in the medical and ‚Äúhelping‚Äù professions.

As we need to embrace diversity, it is crucial to fight a natural urge of all software creators: the will to personally find, design, and implement the solution to every problem. There is no one solution, and if there were, you would probably not be the one to find it. Your role as a software builder is to reach out to the real accessibility experts: those who rely on accessibility and experience its flaws every day, i.e. people with disabilities. Therefore, rather than trying to produce a "perfectly accessible" and inclusive product, we would rather suggest to try and make the main features as inclusive as possible and then get feedback from diverse users on what are their main issues with your software are.

This does not mean either that your expertise is useless if you are not experiencing the discriminations for which you are assessing your products. As you know the product you are building and what experience you are aiming for, you - as a product engineer, designer, or even developer - will be necessary to understanding what can be enhanced.

!!! Tip
    **You should follow the doctrine: "nothing about them without them"**

### There isn't one *"accessible and inclusive design"*

While implementation plays an important role in the inclusiveness, and especially the accessibility of applications, the designers and product leads hold an important responsibility in the process of building an experience that will resonate and be welcoming to the widest range of users possible.

Product design documents, including specifications, user stories and prototypes act as the team‚Äôs compass for delivering products. That is why having inclusiveness in mind from the design is absolutely essential. You don‚Äôt ever have to ‚Äúmake this feature accessible‚Äù if it is built from the ground up with inclusiveness in mind.

Moreover, human experiences are complex and evolving as they always emerge from intersections of those characteristics. Consequently, building an inclusive app is all about staying up to date and actively open to feedback, knowing that we can never reach perfect inclusiveness while doing our best to get there.

!!! Tip
    **People are diverse, solutions to their needs too. Experiment, fail, get feedback, improve and nurture!**

### Accessible code is good code

Bad accessibility can often be a symptom of flawed code. Accessibility and inclusiveness in programming have one key benefit: making you think twice about your code. Stumbling into an accessibility issue might mean that you could be doing something better in a different way.

You code can be good but will never be as robust as one iterated upon by a community of developers or a big company. Therefore, before implementing anything, check rigorously that your framework (or a library) doesn‚Äôt provide a tool that would meet most of your needs.

!!! Tip
    **Your code cannot be good without being accessible and if it's not accessible, it's probably hiding something more.**

## Perspectives

This training is already coming to a close. - If you are doing this training collectively, you are not *quite yet* finished as their is still two modules awaiting you. -

We dearly hope it was somewhat useful to you. We felt that their is a lack of resources that goes into highly technical details while reflecting on them through a systemic gaze and placing empathy as a core element of decision making. We tried our best to provide a training that helped move FOSS in this direction. As we said multiple time, we are not experts, only people trying to help. If you have expertise on those topics and felt like those resources were useful, **please contribute**. If not, you can still [star the repository](https://github.com/Page-and-Maxence/accessibility-and-inclusiveness). If you have any question, feel free to contact us.
